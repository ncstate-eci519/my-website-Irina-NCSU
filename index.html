        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Irina Glabuchek. My husband and I run a small
          software
          development company in Raleigh, NC. He is responsible for the
          technical
          part, customer relations, and overal strategy. I primarily focus on
          our new
          service - chatbot development. Conversational AI design as a subsector
          of
          the rapidly growing AI industry is still at its beginning, and I am
          eager to
          learn about it as much as I can. We use IBM's Watson Assistant, which
          (in my
          humble opinion) is the most user-friendly solution of the top
          chatbot-building platforms today. One has to have no coding experience
          at
          all to be able to build a chatbot with Watson Assistant (although
          knowing a
          programming language will help a lot).</p>
        <p>I am not an educator per se, but sometimes I prepare tutorials and
          mini-courses for our clients. Below is the list of my favorite edtech
          tools.
        </p>
