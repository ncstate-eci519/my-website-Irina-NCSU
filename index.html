    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello. My name is Irina Glabuchek. My husband and I run a small software development company in Raleigh, NC. He is responsible for the technical part, customer relations, and overal strategy. I primarily focus on our new service - chatbot development. Conversational AI design as a subsector of the rapidly growing AI industry is still at its beginning, and I am eager to learn about it as much as I can. We use IBM's Watson Assistant, which (in my humble opinion) is the most user-friendly solution of the top chatbot-building platforms today. One has to have no coding experience at all to be able to build a chatbot with Watson Assistant (although knowing a programming language will help a lot).</p>
    <p>I am not an educator per se, but sometimes I prepare tutorials and mini-courses for our clients. Below is the list of my favorite edtech tools.</p>
